- Improve the week chart (show more details and allow to add/edit bookings from it)
- The language setting must become a user setting
- Include new localizations (see the MySQL table rs_param_lang to localize the application yourself)  (thanks for your German localization, Martin from Switzerland)
- Add the possibility for companies to customise the application with their own logo & colors
- Add a localization interface
- Encrypt the passwords
- Enhance global security
- Add the possibility for admins and/or users to change the date format (thanks Martin)
- Add users to register themselves
- Allow anonymous, read-only user profile to browse bookings (thanks Martin)
- Allow profile locking
